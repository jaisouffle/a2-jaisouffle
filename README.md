## Car Inventory Management System 

Car Inventory Management system that allows you to enter the model, year, and MPG of the car. Additionally, there is a derived field "Age" that calculates how old the car is based on the year entered. The data you input shows up on a table that is dynamically generated and there is functionality that allows you to edit or delete existing entries. Used vanilla CSS, didn't use any libraries. 

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using the edit function the user can modify existing data and save changes as they see fit.

- **Tech Achievement 2**: The application is a single page and the entries made by the user are dynamically updated on a table that is displayed (including the derived field)

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Use of various colors and table styling rules for better UX. The buttons are bold colors that stand out and emphasize their purpose. The table rows generate in alternating colors for better readability.
